# Portfolio

Develop ClojureScript UI components in isolation in a "visual REPL". Increase
your visual bandwidth by seeing your components in various states, screen
resolutions, and other configurations simultaneously.

Portfolio brings some of the best features of
[Storybook.js](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook) to ClojureScript, and
adds a few of its own.

## Status

Portfolio is currently a proof of concept under initial development. Expect
anything to change. Documentation and a generally available candidate should be
around before the end of October.

## Try it out

You can take the Portfolio UI for a spin by cloning this repo, starting
figwheel, and then checking out [http://localhost:5995](http://localhost:5995).
